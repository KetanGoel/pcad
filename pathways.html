            <h2>New Job Work-Flow</h2>
            <p>
              Whenever a new client / job are received, our Pre-Sales team gets working on it to decode 
              it into simpler step by step design. This process involves a round of discussion with the 
              client and exchange of samples in order to understand the client's requirement. Once the 
              client approves the samples, the notes and necessary documentation is transitioned to operations 
              for their trainings and delivery.

            <h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
            <p>
              Once the Pre-sales team gets the client's approval for a sample, QA team gets into action. 
              They start developing checklists for ensuring that QC can be conducted on every file / batch 
              and agreed standard of quality is maintained across the length of a project.

            <h2>Team Assignment and Training</h2>
            <p>
              Operations department, after clearance by pre-sales deploys a team and starts training them on 
              the project specific requirements. Team sizing and identification starts at the time of customer 
              sign-up, however, the project-specific trainings begin only after the samples are approved. 
              These trainings usually last between 1-3 days depending on the complexity / uniqueness of a project. 
              Our in-house training facility can train 3-4 simultaneous batches of upto 20 people.
